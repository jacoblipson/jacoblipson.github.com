						<p>We're not going to spend much time talking about the playoffs in the first week of the season. However, we are gonna take a brief look at the storylines that will be at play in the league this season, starting with the Western Conference.</p>
						<p>This conference is where we find our returning champs, Ethan and Bhas, and indeed we're looking for a dominating performance from these two this semester, at least in conference. Many are hungry for a chance to knock out the title-holders - how many will succeed? Most prominent among these names are Jeff and Sean, who are well esteemed  right now, especially in the eyes of Elo, and Nasser and JArbaugh, who everyone expects big things of. Beyond these three, you have Will and Chenji, who remain hard to pin down ability-wise.  You have Santosh and Jovi, who are inconsistent and therefore low-ranked, but clearly talented old hats. You have Josue, who has played superbly over the last few days teamed up with Hugo, who has played subpar. There are Charlie and Danny, who also throw their hat in the ring of teams that could be competitive in this division, though don't strike us as excellent right now. There are also two teams of newcomers (Steven and Jerry and Justin and Adam), who I'm reticent to get excited for yet. And last but not least, there are two teams of Lost Boys, who may perform well in conference, but don't give us a reason to root for them. I'll say this: it truly is anybody's guess who'll compose the top 7 in the west, and it's exciting to see a lot of low-ranked teams with a genuine chance to climb the standings.</p>
						<p>To sum up, here's what you might want to look for in the west:
							<ul>
								<li>Do Bhas and Ethan bring the fire they had last semester?</li>
								<li>Do Nick and Jon live up to the hype?</li>
								<li>Is Josue better this semester? Is it enough?</li>
								<li>What do we make of Santosh and Jovi?</li>
								<li>Will James and James or Jay and Adam give them a reason to care about them?</li>
								<li>Will Jerry play on the Shabbos?</li>
							</ul>

						<h2 id="ec">EASTERN CONFERENCE</h2>
						<iframe id='east' src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vYuVPk87Ka6v8Ts39x5mo-igFvQyz7Kb1nX--CBm1Ak/pubhtml?gid=1565274915&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
						<p>This freaking conference. This is where the real antics start. Larry? He's here! Ian Luo? Him too! Bobby? Or wait is that Richard? Which one is Barton again? Worry not - they're all here! More seriously, we've got Marcus, Larry, Bobby, Richard, Temi, John Bailey, Watson and Eli all in one conference. 7 of the top 10 Season 1 Golden Hand players in one setup, 11 of the top 16. So let's get started.</p>
						<p>Bobby and Richard are the top ranked, but haven't earned the prestige, so they might not be here in a few weeks. Bobby stood tall next to Chris last semester, who made less than 3 cups per game, while Richard had pretty solid support from Tosh, as streaky as he was. There's real potential here, but also plenty of room to fail. Marcus and I are neck and neck with them Elo-wise, and there's reason for us to be optimistic too. Watson's the only player in our conference to have bested us yet, my ruit star is still rising, and we have the previous league cups leader on our side so good things could be in our future. Also it's weird to write about yourself, so let's be done with that. The last of the big three in the East is LarBear and Elliot. It's hard to give Larry shit for last season considering that one time he made 21 cups in 4th OT. But he and Jovi did end up a clear 3rd last season so I guess the question for Larry is will he outshine Elliot at the cost of the team or will they be a stronger unit than his last?</p>
						<p>Wow, can you believe that all of the above only covers three teams? That's how great this collection of teams will be! Also potentially making big waves this season are Watson and Barton, Barton likely being a more cohesive partner for Watson. Temi and Spencer too can shine, but the pressure is really on Spencer to perform after an average first semester. Eli and Garon don't strike me as contenders for the top, but Eli seems to me to have flown under the radar as an excellent player, so if Garon lends a bit more support than Adam, here's another team that's no pushover.</p>
						<p>The next tier in my mind consists of Harrison and Adam (I saw them play: they're hyping themselves up way too much), Jason and John, Matt and Ian, and Nick and Ian. In this conference only one or two of these teams will have the chance to move on, and it's all up to the matches against one another. Each is a capable team, but there isn't a lot of room for error in this conference. Finally, we end up with Chad and Noah, who are surely due for a win or two. They're very coachable!</p>
						<p>To sum up, here's what you might want to look for in the east:
							<ul>
								<li>Is Elliot a better partner than Jovi was?</li>
								<li>How good is Barton? Better than Spencer? The more dominant of these two will probably be on the more competitive team.</li>
								<li>What's up with Eli and Garon?</li>
								<li>How many teams will actually be in the dog fight for the eventualy top 7 finish? Will it be 4 or 5 competing for those coveted spots, or just 2 or 3?</li>
								<li>Can Nick and Ian close a game for the love of God?</li>
								<li>Does John Bailey continue to shine and are he and Jason competitive?</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>That's all for the conference once-overs, stay tuned for the results to all of the scintilating questions above!</p>
