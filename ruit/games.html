						<p>Welcome to your Week 2 games and odds! This week we have two games, which is exciting standings-wise and also it means that after this week we'll have some real data to play with! Unfortunately, the Elo ratings have yet to stabilize, so our guesses are likely going to be a bit off but hey who knows! Last week, we had totally unproved numbers but 9 out of 11 winners predicted correctly! Four games were predicted down to half a cup, and six were within a cup and a half! So good start but who knows. This week, the two games will be played but not in order, so both games will use the W1 ratings for predictions rather than using game 2 to predict game 3. However, Elo ratings will reflect both games after this week. More about this week: pay attention to the two close matches Harrison and Adam will play against two teams they're competing with hotly for playoff spots. Time for the tough-talking squad to prove they're not struggling to stay above water. The other storylines include big games for the mambas, who have a grudge match against Watson and Barton and then a chance to prove their worth against Richard and Bobby, and two competitive games for Marcus and me that we're probably over-favored for.</p>

						<p>Here are your week 1 games and the Elo odds! The first two columns highlight a team's supposed odds, but until the Elo ratings for the untested teams stabilize, they aren't super useful yet. Next to them are the Elo projected cup differentials, and next to that are my predictions. Predictions in purple are the same as Elo's rounded to the nearest whole cup, predictions in pink are deviations by 1 cup. I don't predict any games to deviate by more than 1 cup this week. All games are out of conference so look for eastern teams to score a couple of easy wins, but also look for whether any teams in the west can pick up some tough points and get ahead in their conference.</p>
