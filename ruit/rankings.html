						<p>First games are in the books! With their completion, we already have some quick changes in the standings as the new teams finally get to show their mettle. So far, my initial rankings have been somewhat accurate, as seven of the eight initial top teams won their games this week, and the top six teams didn't even change their position in the Elo rankings. Equally predictable is the volatility amongst the teams with players we've never seen before. Kiefner's team rose 5 spots, JArbaugh and Nasser dropped 5 spots, Justin and Adam M. fell 3, Steven and Jerry fell 4, and Jay pulled up Kronish by 3 spots. Less depressed are Harrison and Adam, who only fell one spot in the rankings but lost 13 points (which is a reasonable amount FYI), as well as Matt and Ian who played a great game against Bhas and Ethan but still lost 15 points though they saved their spot. There's not a whole lot else to say here, since it's still too early to make conclusions about this many teams with so many new players, but keep watching the top of the pack. Some of the teams are going to start dropping by nature of the tough Leo Greenberg conference, while some of the middle of the pack teams will rise by virtue of playing in their less competitive Joel Conference. This time next week, we'll have two more games in the books, and lots more opinions!</p>

						<p>So here is where we stand going into TCRL Season 2: on very uncertain ground. A quick summary of how I got these numbers: For returning teams, I just used their Elo at the end of last season. For returning players on new teams, I took their % of cups made for their team, multiplied that by their old Elo, and added that to their new partner's Elo value. For new players, I gave them half of the mean team's Elo (964/2 = 482), then added 5, subtracted 5, or did nothing based on the "Eye Test", aka who do I think is half decent. New players like Sean may be disadvantaged by only getting a 5 point bump when he's likely much much better than 5 points above the average player, but there's only so much I can do and still maintain the integrity of the numbers. After all that, I reverted all the teams' ratings back towards the mean by one third.</p>
						<p>Now that that's hashed out, let's take a brief look at the teams. Up at the top, Bobby and Richard, Marcus and I, Larry and Elliot, and Bhas and Ethan are all neck and neck as one would expect. Right behind are Watson and Barton and Jeff and Sean, each team buoyed by their returning player. Take a fair jump down the ratings to Temi and Spencer and Eli and Garon, teams with real potential to shine but no math to back that up yet. After that, you have 7 teams in the middle before you hit the next tier. Prosser and Kiefner and Jay and Adam are sitting low now, once again because of the Elo rating of the returning partners. Santosh and Jovi sit behind them, but are perhaps most likely to climb as they attempt to make Richard and Larry jealous of ever leaving them. After that are poor Ian and Nick, who just can't finish a last cup for their lives, the new team Shenanigans, Charlie and Danny, and two teams with very low expectations: Hugo and Josue, and Chad and Noah who are still in need of a first win.</p>
						<p>So that's what we have! Expect a lot of movement in the middle, and a number of the teams at the top and bottom to move towards the middle. 'Tis only natural. We'll check back in on Sunday, but there won't be real movement here for at least a few games, so be patient and expect the quality of the predictions to go up with time.</p>
