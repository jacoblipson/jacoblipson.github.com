				<h2>Scholarship</h2>
				<img class="philpicl" src="photos/toshrun1.jpg">
				<p>Tufts Prism Run, Tufts' first ever campus-wide paint run, took place on October 27. Inspired by the Indian holiday Holi, the Tufts Prism Run had participants running, jogging, walking, or somersaulting through Tufts campus showered by an array of washable colored powders. Over four thousand dollars were raised at the event for <a href="www.directrelief.org">Direct Relief</a>, a non-profit organization aiming to increase the quality of life of people around the world by providing medical supplies to local, national, and international health providers. Check out the Tufts Daily's coverage of the Prism Run <a href="http://www.tuftsdaily.com/news/student-organizations-team-up-for-color-run-1.2842691#.UtYT3mRDvy0">here</a> or look at pictures from the event <a href="http://blogs.tuftsdaily.com/?p=11552">here</a>!</p>

				<h2>Health and Safety</h2>
				<p>The Vice President of Health and Safety organizes guest speakers to share their knowledge of various health and safety topics with the brotherhood, teaching us about such issues as mental health awareness, anxiety, and recognizing alcohol poisoning. Additionally, he helps to coordinate campus-wide events and campaigns that address serious health issues to help inform the entire Tufts community. He also acts as a bridge between Theta Chi and the plethora of resources that Tufts has to offer its students.</p>

				<h2>Alumni Involvement</h2>
				<img class="philpicl" src="photos/alumni.jpg">
				<p>The purpose of the alumni co-chairs is to make good on the promise that Theta Chi is a lifelong brotherhood. We act as a resource for alumni to maintain their involvement and as a liaison between current and former members of the house. Our primary goals are to plan events where the alumni can interact with current house members, and create opportunities for them to give back to the house however they feel comfortable. We have some exciting things coming up this semester, with the annual Spring Fling activities, various other events, and the intended reinstatement of Beta Chi, our alumni organization, as a 501(c) organization.The current alumni co-chairs are Harrison Shapiro (2016) and Colin Burnett (2016).</p>
