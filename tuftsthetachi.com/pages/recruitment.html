				<h2>Recruitment 2014</h2>

				<p>Fraternity Rush for Spring 2014 ended on Friday, January 24th, after a full week of Flatbread Pizza and Bowling, Trampoline Dodgeball, and Redbones barbecue. But if you missed rush, that doesn't mean you've missed the window to join Theta Chi or get to know our brotherhood. If you're considering fraternity life, please drop our recruitment chair, Barton Liang, a line at a href="&#109;a&#105;l&#116;&#111;:&#114;&#101;&#99;&#114;&#117;&#105;&#116;&#109;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#64;&#116;&#117;&#102;&#116;&#115;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#116;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#105;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">this email address</a>. Though we don't offer bids until next fall's sophomore rush process, we're happy to answer any questions you might have or bring you over to hang out at our house on 100 Packard Ave to get to know you outside of the rush process.  Joining Theta Chi was, for many of our brothers, one of the best decisions of their lives, so it's not hard to get us to talk about it!
