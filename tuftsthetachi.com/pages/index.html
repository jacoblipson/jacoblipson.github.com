					<h3>A Note from the President</h3>
					<p>Here will be a note from Jake, our current president.</p>
					<p>Hopefully, he'll take the time to write something thoughtful, instead of saying the first absurd thing that comes to his head. You know, I often worry that his good looks and charm have insulated him from the outside world. He might not think to list the many ways that his fraternity has bettered his life, including challenging him to excel academically, convincing him to devote more of his time to philanthropy, and forcing him to be more social than the awkward freshman he was when he first came to Tufts. He might also think it nice to mention how transformative his experiences have been connecting to such a diverse and accomplished group of men that challenge him to be a better person at all times.</p>
					<p>But I doubt he'll come up with all of that. After all, it's not like he's constantly surrounded by reminders that the best decision he's made since coming to Tufts was rushing Theta Chi. And even if he did think to mention all of those things, he probably wouldn't remember to publicize the information on this website including the latest updates on Theta Chi's philanthropic efforts (under "An Assisting Hand") and contact information for getting in touch with the fraternity. Of all the wonderful things he may not say to you, however, he should make sure not to leave out that we're very proud to be a part of Tufts, and strive to positively impact a community we care so much about. We can only hope he doesn't forget to share that with you.</p>

					<p>He'll probably remember to thank you for checking us out and invite you over to 100 Packard Avenue to get to know us soon. He's good with little things like that.</p>

					<p id="best">Best,</p>
