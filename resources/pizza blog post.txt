	        		<h2>Tufts' Best College Pizza: #1 - A quest for the best slice</h2>
	        		<hr>
	        		<p>As a former youth, I came to college with the conception that pizza would be the sole source of sustenance for the duration of my four years. Unfortunately, I’ve never needed a great excuse to avoid the gym (though Tufts’ delightful Boston winters provide me with a readily available one), and instead compensated by eating healthier. Obviously, this has quite setback my pizza plans. However, there’s something wonderful about the niche of cheap, average college pizza that everyone has at some point enjoyed, besides the fact that nothing satisfies a drunken craving better than greasy cheese, tomato and bread. As every Tufts student will tell you, there’s also something wonderful about having strong opinions about things that don’t really matter that much. To that end, I have decided to embark on a quest to find the best college pizza one can consume at Tufts, so that I too can have the fond memories of cheap late night pizza that so many family members and friends have recanted to me in days past.</p>
					<p>The challenge is this: to try as many college pizza joints that deliver to Tufts (or more appropriately, my apartment one block away from campus) as possible. 
					<p>So, without further ado, here’s the list of places I’ll pull from to hit, having searched Yelp, Grubhub, and Foodler. I limited my list to the 50 most likely candidates. Those who are very far away or very poorly reviewed were preemptively cut because the odds that I make it through 50 different places is very unlikely, let alone any more than that. I’ve tried to filter out the places that don’t deliver or don’t offer the college pizza I’ve tried to describe above, but I may find that I’ve missed some as I go. If that happens, I’ll cross it off the list and pick another for my review. If you see one I’ve missed, you’re more than welcome to recommend it to me – just let me know by emailing me at Jacob.Lipson@tufts.edu! Let the adventure begin!</p>
