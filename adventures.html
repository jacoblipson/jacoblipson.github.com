	        		<hr>
	        		<p>As a former youth, I came to college with the conception that pizza would be the sole source of sustenance for the duration of my four years. Unfortunately, I’ve never needed a great excuse to avoid the gym (though Tufts’ delightful Boston winters provide me with a readily available one), and instead compensated by eating healthier. Obviously, this has quite setback my pizza plans. However, there’s something wonderful about the niche of cheap, average college pizza that everyone has at some point enjoyed, besides the fact that nothing satisfies a drunken craving better than greasy cheese, tomato and bread. As every Tufts student will tell you, there’s also something wonderful about having strong opinions about things that don’t really matter that much. To that end, I have decided to embark on a quest to find the best college pizza one can consume at Tufts, so that I too can have the fond memories of cheap late night pizza that so many family members and friends have recanted to me in days past.</p>
					<p>The challenge is this: to try every college pizza joint that delivers to Tufts (or more appropriately, my apartment one block away from campus). The rules are completely arbitrary, but are as follows:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>I will order a pepperoni pizza. I will actually probably order a half-pepperoni/half-cheese pizza, because my girlfriend does not eat red meat, but this is not an issue as I do not need to eat the entire pizza. If I go to these places in person, I will probably actually just order slices but really, it doesn’t matter that much. I chose pepperoni because it’s a staple of pizza culture, as well as my personal preference but since I’ll likely end up trying a slice of cheese every now and again, I might slip in a few notes about that too.</li>
						<li>I will evaluate each joint’s pizza for the following qualities on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being the best): crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, and overall ensemble.</li>
						<li>I will add, detract, or do nothing about a single point for the affordability of the pizza.</li>
						<li>I will only order from late night pizza places (open after 9 PM).</li>
						<li>I will make note of the speed of delivery service though I won’t give that quality a score.</li>
						<li>I will force myself to eat said pizza when I am neither absurdly hungry nor completely full, as these extremes are known to greatly influence how much one enjoys something. There’s no standardization process I can use here besides being cognizant of my hunger. To that end, I will also not be (particularly) drunk while eating this pizza.</li>
						<li>I may also order something like garlic/spicy fries to go with the pizza. This won’t influence the scoring of the pizza, but might factor into my final decision as a tiebreaker of some sort.</li>
						<li>Pizza joints must deliver to Tufts University’s Medford/Somerville campus (and preferably to my place nearby).</li>
						<li>The pizza must be cheap. There’s wiggle room here, but I’m not planning on looking at places where a large pizza costs much more than $15, nor do I want to pay $7 in delivery fees.</li>
						<li>No big chains. Sorry Domino’s and Pizza Hut, you’re great, but you ain’t special.</li>
						<li>I will be revisiting the couple of places I’ve already been to so as to give them an unbiased review.</li>
						<li>I’ve added my two university dining halls to the list because frankly, most people reading this are Tufts students and they’re essential to the Tufts pizza dialogue.</li>
						<li>I will not use the abbreviation ‘za’ for any reason.</li>
						<li>I will have a ton of fun and quite possibly gain weight.</li>
					</ol>
					<br/>
					<p>So, without further ado, here’s the list of places I’ll pull from to hit, having searched Yelp, Grubhub, and Foodler. I limited my list to the 50 most likely candidates. Those who are very far away or very poorly reviewed were preemptively cut because the odds that I make it through 50 different places is very unlikely, let alone any more than that. I’ve tried to filter out the places that don’t deliver or don’t offer the college pizza I’ve tried to describe above, but I may find that I’ve missed some as I go. If that happens, I’ll cross it off the list and pick another for my review. If you see one I’ve missed, you’re more than welcome to recommend it to me – just let me know by emailing me at Jacob.Lipson@tufts.edu! Let the adventure begin!</p>
